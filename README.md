# Day 3: Treasure Island

## About

This project is a simple, text-based "choose your own adventure" game, created as part of the '100 Days of Code' Python bootcamp. The player makes a series of choices that determine the outcome of the story, leading to either treasure or peril.

## Key Learnings

* Building complex logical flows using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
* Implementing **nested conditionals** to handle multiple layers of choices.
* Using the `.lower()` method to handle user input in a non-case-sensitive way.
* Controlling the program's path based on user decisions to create an interactive story.
* Applying logical operators to create different branches in the game.
